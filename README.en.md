2026-10-23 update: **Cross-source result canonicalization**. An authenticated, deterministic computation with a usable workbench, bounded input validation and regression tests. No external model calls or business-data writes. [Usage, API and limitations](docs/AI_PRACTICAL_UPGRADE_20261023.md).

# ZhuaTech Enterprise Search

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise finance, planning, settlement, and risk control.

ZhuaTech Enterprise Search provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise finance, planning, settlement, and risk control. It is designed for finance teams, business controllers, approvers, and operations managers, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise enterprise search, self-hosted enterprise search, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.


## Update: Search authorization filtering and rerank budgets

This release adds an authenticated, structured batch workspace at `/operations.html`, backed by project-specific deterministic calculations, explicit validation, explainable decisions, and CSV/JSON exports. Decimal values are preserved exactly; no external model call is made.

Results are **read-only decision support**, not approvals or posted transactions. The feature does not send payments, sign contracts, destroy records, or control devices, and does not certify the whole application for production. See [the calculation contract and API guide](docs/OPERATIONS-REVIEW.md).
## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Finance teams, business controllers, approvers, and operations managers.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Financial master data and policies** — Manage financial master data and policies with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Transaction and document workflows** — Coordinate transaction and document workflows through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Approval and segregation of duties** — Track approval and segregation of duties metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Reconciliation and exception handling** — Preserve reconciliation and exception handling evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Management reporting and forecasts** — Expose management reporting and forecasts in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Immutable audit and evidence trails** — Connect immutable audit and evidence trails to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.

## Input comparison and versioned snapshots

The existing **Search authorization filtering and rerank budgets** calculation now supports a two-scenario workspace at `/comparison.html`. Both sides are recalculated with the current domain algorithm, paired by identifier, and shown with added/removed records, field-level changes and exact decimal deltas. Search, filtering, pagination and complete CSV/JSON exports are available. Versioned input snapshots are validated by the authenticated backend before atomic replacement; failed imports keep current input intact.

Snapshots identify the project, input contract and algorithm version. A less restrictive recommendation does not prove lower real-world risk. Input hashes are not signatures, and response actor/time metadata is not a persisted audit log. No model call or business write is added; this is not whole-system production certification. See [the comparison and API guide](docs/INPUT-COMPARISON.md).
